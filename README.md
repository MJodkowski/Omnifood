This website was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for the needs of the Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 course offered through Udemy.

The positioning techniques that Jonas demonstrates throughout the course, however, are quite outdated by today's standards, so I decided to rebuild the website from the ground up using flexbox. I also got rid of jQuery in favor of pure JS.
