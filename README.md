This website was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann as part of the Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 course offered through Udemy.

The positioning techniques that Jonas demonstrates, however, are quite outdated by today's standards, so I decided to rebuild the website from the ground up using flexbox. Also, I got rid of jQuery and substituted it with pure JS.
